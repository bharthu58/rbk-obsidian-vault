## Overview

Two dominant approaches to building AI agent workflows: **N8N** (visual, no-code automation) and **LangGraph** (code-first, graph-based multi-agent). Both connect AI with tools and external systems but differ fundamentally in paradigm.

---

## N8N — Visual Agent Workflow Builder

**What it is:** Open-source automation tool. Visually build workflows by connecting services, APIs, and AI tools in a sequence. Self-hostable, no per-workflow cost.

**How it works:**
1. Input from user
2. AI Agent processes it
3. Agent can make a **Tool Call** or access **Memory**
4. **Decision node** chooses next action
5. Produces **LLM Output**

**Best for:**
- Non-developer teams building automation
- Integrating AI with external services (APIs, databases, messaging)
- Rapid workflow prototyping
- Self-hosted, cost-controlled deployments

**Strengths:**
- Visual drag-and-drop UI — no Python required
- 400+ built-in integrations
- Self-hostable (unlimited free workflows)
- Claude Code can generate n8n configs from natural language descriptions

## LangGraph — Graph-Based Multi-Agent Framework

**What it is:** Python framework for building AI Agent workflows using a flexible graph structure. Supports branching, looping, and multi-agent collaboration.

**How it works:**
1. Shared **State** containing workflow context
2. Routes tasks to different **Agents** (Agent 1, Agent 2…)
3. Agents interact with a **Tool Node** to perform tasks
4. **Conditional node** decides: Retry or Done
5. → Continue (loop) or End

**Best for:**
- Developers building complex, stateful multi-agent systems
- Workflows requiring dynamic branching and loops
- Fine-grained control over agent interactions
- Production-grade agent systems

**Strengths:**
- Full Python expressiveness
- Explicit state management — shared context across agents
- Conditional branching and retry logic built-in
- Multi-agent collaboration with tool sharing

## Comparison

| Dimension | N8N | LangGraph |
|---|---|---|
| Paradigm | Visual workflow builder | Code-first graph framework |
| Target user | Non-developers / ops teams | Python developers |
| Multi-agent | Single agent + tools | Native multi-agent with shared state |
| Control flow | Linear with decision nodes | Graph: branches, loops, conditionals |
| State management | Per-node memory | Explicit shared state object |
| Deployment | Self-hosted or cloud | Embedded in Python app |
| Cost model | Self-hosted = free | Open source, infrastructure cost only |
| Learning curve | Low | Medium-High (Python + graph concepts) |

## When to Use Each

**N8N:** You want to automate workflows connecting AI to SaaS tools, messaging, databases — without writing Python. Good for ops, marketing, and business automation.

**LangGraph:** You're a developer building a stateful multi-agent system where agents collaborate, retry, branch, and share context. Production-grade, complex orchestration.

**Hybrid approach:** Use N8N as the orchestration layer for business workflows, with LangGraph handling the AI reasoning sub-tasks that need complex branching.
