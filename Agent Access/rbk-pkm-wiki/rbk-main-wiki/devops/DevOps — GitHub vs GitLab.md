## Summary

GitHub emphasises ease of use and community collaboration — ideal for open-source and teams that value simplicity and ecosystem breadth. GitLab focuses on providing a comprehensive integrated DevOps platform — suited for organisations that want built-in CI/CD, security, and infrastructure management with greater control.

|---|---|---|
| Primary Focus | Community-driven collaboration, especially open-source | End-to-end DevOps platform covering the full SDLC |
| Core Functionality | Git VCS, repository hosting, issue tracking, code review, project management | Git VCS, repository hosting, issue tracking, code review, project management |
| Strengths | Large developer community; extensive third-party integrations; user-friendly interface | Built-in CI/CD; integrated security and infrastructure tools; all-in-one DevOps platform |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions — emphasis on integrations | Native, fully integrated CI/CD pipelines |
| Weaknesses | Fewer built-in DevOps features; reliance on third-party tools | Greater complexity; steeper learning curve |
| Deployment | Primarily SaaS | SaaS and self-hosted options |

## Decision Matrix

| Use Case / Requirement | GitHub | GitLab |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Open-source collaboration | ✅ | ⚠️ |
| All-in-one DevOps platform | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| Built-in CI/CD required | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| Ease of use / quick onboarding | ✅ | ⚠️ |
| Enterprise control & customisation | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| Self-hosting requirement | ❌ | ✅ |

✅ = Strong fit &nbsp; ⚠️ = Possible fit with trade-offs &nbsp; ❌ = Not supported / limited

## Quick Guidance

**Use GitHub if:** Your team is open-source-first, values a large community and integration ecosystem, wants the simplest onboarding, and is comfortable using separate CI tools (GitHub Actions + third-party).

**Use GitLab if:** Your organisation wants one platform covering the entire SDLC, needs self-hosting, wants native CI/CD tightly integrated with the repo, and has the engineering capacity to manage a more complex platform.
