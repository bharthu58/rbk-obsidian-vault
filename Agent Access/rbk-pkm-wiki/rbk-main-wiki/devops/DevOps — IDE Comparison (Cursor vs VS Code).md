title: "DevOps — IDE Comparison (Cursor vs VS Code)"
version: 1.1
date: 2026-04-16
changes: "v1.0: Created from MyLearn/AI/rbk-queries-during-ai-discovery-phase.md. v1.1: Added VS Code extensions section from ingested/notes/vscode.md"

## Overview

Cursor is built directly on the VS Code codebase — it retains a familiar interface while being rebuilt for AI-first coding. The choice comes down to whether you optimise for flexibility (VS Code) or a streamlined AI workflow (Cursor).

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | VS Code | Cursor |
|---|---|---|
| AI integration | Extensions (GitHub Copilot, Continue, etc.) | Native, built-in — core to the IDE |
| Codebase understanding | Per-extension capability | Project-wide AI analysis — smarter multi-file edits |
| Chat interface | Extension-based | Dedicated chat panel with inline diffs |
| Composer mode | ❌ | ✅ — generate entire projects from prompts |
| Multi-model support | Depends on extension | Switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. in one session |
| Tab completion | Standard AI extensions | More predictive multi-line suggestions |
| AI code review | ❌ / BugBot via extension | ✅ BugBot — AI reviews PRs |
| Learning/explanation | Via chat extension | Built-in — explains code, errors, context like a coach |
| Extension ecosystem | Massive | VS Code extensions work (same codebase) |
| Team collaboration | Standard | Shared chats, shared rules |

## When to Choose Each

**Choose Cursor:**
- You want AI deeply integrated into every edit, not added as an afterthought
- You work across multiple files and want the AI to understand the full codebase context
- You prefer a unified multi-model interface (switch Claude/GPT/etc. in one tool)
- You want "Composer" — describe a feature in natural language, get a multi-file implementation
- You're newer to a codebase and want coaching-style explanations

**Choose VS Code:**
- You rely on specific extensions that don't exist or behave differently in Cursor
- Your team has heavily standardised on VS Code configs/settings
- You want maximum flexibility with your choice of AI tools
- You prefer AI as an optional layer, not the centre of the IDE

## Coexistence

Many developers use both:
- **Cursor** for AI-heavy sessions (architecture work, refactoring, new features)
- **VS Code** for tasks requiring specific extensions or team-standardised tooling

Both read the same project files — switching between them is frictionless.

## Notable VS Code Extensions

| Extension | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **GitLens** | Enhances VS Code's built-in Git: inline blame annotations, commit history exploration, visual comparison tools. Understand code evolution without leaving the editor. |
| **Live Server** | Launches a local dev server with automatic browser refresh on file changes. Essential for web development. |
