# RBK PKM Wiki — Overview

*Start every new session here. This page is the persistent context — read it before doing anything else.*

---

## What This Wiki Is

A personal knowledge base maintained by LLM agents using the [[LLM Wiki Pattern]]. Sources are dropped into `raw/`, ingested into synthesised wiki pages, and queried against as a compounding knowledge base. The wiki gets richer with every source and every session.

The wiki lives inside an Obsidian vault. It is version-controlled via git. Agent access is scoped to `Agent Access/rbk-pkm-wiki/` — everything outside is private and off-limits unless explicitly requested.

```

**Key structural note:** `wiki_root` in `wiki-config.md` points to the `rbk-pkm-wiki/` directory (where `raw/` and `ingested/` live), not to `rbk-main-wiki/`. Wiki pages go in `rbk-main-wiki/`.

## Wiki Skills

| Skill | Command | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| wiki-ingest | `/wiki-ingest` | Reads `raw/`, synthesises wiki pages, moves sources to `ingested/` |
| wiki-query | `/wiki-query` | Answers questions from wiki pages with `[[wikilink]]` citations |
| wiki-lint | `/wiki-lint` | Health-checks links, orphans, stale index entries |
| wiki-integrate | `/wiki-integrate` | Weaves a new/updated page into the knowledge graph |
| wiki-crystallize | `/wiki-crystallize` | Distils a session into a structured wiki page |

## Source Notes

- **MyLearn/** — personal learning notes, bulk-ingested 2026-04-16. Folder subsequently deleted. All readable sources synthesised into wiki pages; images moved to `ingested/assets/`.
- **Uningested sources (deleted, contents not captured):** `Claude-Code-PromptContract.gdoc`, `RBK useful prompts.gdoc` — Google Docs format, never exported.

## Operational Notes (from initialization session)

- **Images in `raw/assets/`** can be read via vision during ingest — do not skip them; they often carry the main content of a clipping (e.g. feature maps, diagrams).
- **`raw/` has subdirs** (`web-clippings/`, `assets/`) — ingest must traverse them, not just the flat root.
- **Ingest atomic commit:** move the source file to `ingested/[subdir]/` only after the wiki page is written. If the move fails, leave the file in `raw/` for retry.
- **`changes:` frontmatter** on every wiki page is the traceability link — wiki-lint uses it to confirm sources are not orphaned.
- **`log.md` is append-only** — new entries at the top; never edit existing entries.

## Live Dashboard

*Requires Dataview plugin. Install via Community Plugins if not yet installed.*

**Recently updated pages:**
```dataview
TABLE version, date FROM "Agent Access/rbk-pkm-wiki/rbk-main-wiki"
WHERE file.name != "Overview" AND file.name != "index" AND file.name != "log"
SORT date DESC
LIMIT 10
```

**Pages by domain:**
```dataview
TABLE file.folder AS Domain, version, date FROM "Agent Access/rbk-pkm-wiki/rbk-main-wiki"
WHERE file.name != "Overview" AND file.name != "index" AND file.name != "log"
SORT file.folder ASC
```

## Session Bootstrap Checklist

When starting a new session:
1. Read this `Overview.md`
2. Read `index.md` for the current page catalogue
3. Check `raw/` for any new sources to ingest
4. Check `log.md` top entry to see what was done last
